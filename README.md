# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

Part of my Software Engineering degree at Curtin University Colombo in 2023.  

This unit focused on implementing and analyzing **fundamental data structures** and **algorithmic techniques**. 
My final mark was **88%**.

## Syllabus  

> This unit explored the use of **fundamental data structures** and **algorithmic techniques** in computing to design efficient software applications.  
>  
> The unit demonstrates how various **recursive and iterative algorithms** work to solve specific problems, such as:  
> - Sorting  
> - Implementing operations on **stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, hash tables, and heaps**

## Assignment  

Developed an **application that models a Mall** and the shops within it.  

### **Features:**  
✅ **Shop finding and navigation system**  
✅ **Adding new shops, updating shops, and managing pathways**  
✅ **Displaying adjacency list/matrix view of shops**  
✅ **Hashtable load factor calculation**  
✅ **Shortest path calculation between shops**  

The program integrates **all data structures** learned throughout the unit.

## Weekly Worksheets  

Each week required completing a **worksheet** focusing on a **specific data structure** through a **small programming exercise**.  

**Final programs are uploaded**, but won't make sense on their own because the worksheets themselves **cannot be shared due to copyright**.
